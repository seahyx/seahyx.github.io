## Hi there, seahyx here

I am a programmer. I do **web front/backend** development, **mobile** development, and make things I see myself using. I also like 3d modelling and making games!

I value *simplicity* and *functionality*. And that is totally not an excuse for being lazy. Of course, that means that dark mode is indispensible.
