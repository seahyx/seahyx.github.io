A better life choice.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seahyx/Woody-Theme/master/img/img-1.png "Normal coding conditions")

### Nature right on your screen

Without the risk of venturing out into the cruel and dangerous outside world, you can enjoy the scenery of a dense forest right on your screen! Absolutely life-changing. Totally safe.

### It's brown,

>warm, and undoubtedly woody. With a tinge of amber and teal. Just like real wood. But it's not real wood so go out and see some real wood. Morning wood not included.

Now, here's some more screenshots for your mindless consumption, because most people find reading an excrutiatingly stressful task.

You may have noticed italics have been kept to a minimum. On certain fonts, I find them rather distracting. The different colours help to differentiate terms more comfortably to the eye.

![Or you just happened to get the short end of the stick of internet bandwidth. I think some guy working in your ISP probably was like, 'I don't like this IP address, let's just give it half a wire of bandwidth.' and laughed about it.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seahyx/Woody-Theme/master/img/img-4.png "The settings page")

### More information

wOw, things that people may sometimes care about!

This is a personal project. I found a striking lack of warm colour themes on the extension market. I don't understand. Why would people put so much on their screen, when in the end night comes and they decide to put a blue-light filter on their screen anyway? And what's with some text with absolutely no contrast with the background? Are you trying to make art or write code?

I've based this off the Bear Theme [[market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme "Visual Studio Code Marketplace")/[repo](https://github.com/slack-theme/visual-studio-code "GitHub Repository")]. It is pretty heartwarming, like a bear hugging your face, but you know what it lacked? **Wood.** Plenty of wood. What's a bear doing in a cold, hard, place? It belongs in the forest, and that's what I gave it.

I was also inspired by the Slack Theme [[market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dahong.theme-bear "Visual Studio Code Marketplace")/[repo](https://github.com/shaodahong/theme-bear "GitHub Repository")] (and their readme file), and I used it to decide where the colours should go. There are plenty of other additions on top of all that, to make sure that you don't lose the illusion of being in a beautiful, fake forest.

Otherwise, I would like to thank whoever made the Extension Generator Tool to help me create this masterpiece.
