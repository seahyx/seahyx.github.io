## A Fantasy Subverted

A fiction about an immortal man, a typical cliched fantasy world, and how insignificant it all is.

------

## Synopsis

Every two hundred and ninety years, heroes are summoned from alternate worlds to fight the demon horde. Emerging from unknown territory, these carnal machines of death are hungry to devour human-folk. The common folk and heroes alike, form pacts with living gods, who hold unimaginable power, to fight beasts and demons emerging from ancient dungeons and ruins.

Frankly, on the surface, this world is really just full of clich√©s and overused fantasy tropes. However, a ray of hope presents itself.

Be it fate or destiny, He landed on this rock of all things. His reason? A vacation. An escape from reality only He can pull off. He an immortal man, as ancient as they come. However, the universe may have more in store for him than he expected.

Subverting the laws of the world, He will discover the secrets of this world (no, really), and show the world how insignificant it is to be stuck on a rock.
