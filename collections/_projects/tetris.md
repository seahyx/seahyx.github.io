## tetris - PIXI.js

A mini tetris game made using HTML 5 and [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com).
My first project done in javascript. The code is absolutely horrible but I learned some great things from it.

## Features:

- Full wall-kicking ability for sweet T-spins and even L-spins and I-spins.
- Scoring system that evaluates base on combos, tricks and skill.
- Next shape preview.
- Replayable
- Limited scalability; easy to add new shapes and objects
- No download required and cross-platform compatible
